    "# Loan Approval Prediction\n",
    "Edmund Walsh - May 10th, 2020\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "The project examines the data provided by the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) which requires mortgage lenders in the United States to disclose information about the mortgage lending decisions they have made. Specifically, we will be examining prediction of whether or not an application will be accepted or denied.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is part of a short 5-day project whose purpose goes beyond the acceptance prediction of mortgages. The focus of this project is more about the process and end-to-end engineering from raw data to results and presentation. This notebook will focus on the data science approach and process and highlight a roadmap best illustrated in the image below:"

    "## A Ground Up Approach\n",
    "The pyramid above is such a good illustration because the process truly is building in a step-by-step fashion \n",
    "towards the ultimate goal of finding useful results that are actionable and impactful in the real world. \n",
    "The end results get all of the attention, but a project is unlikely to be successful without these strong foundations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Context \n",
    "While this project request didn't specifically state 'why' we are looking into this data, I will work within the context of three important rationales.\n",
    "1. Mortgage due diligence is expensive and time intensive. A process that can more reliably expidite the process will save lenders significant time and resources.\n",
    "2. From a regulatory perspective and also importantly as Machine Intelligence becomse a larger and more common part of this process it is important for us to be aware of and highlight any bias.\n",
    "3. Some financial instituions may be more or less likely to issue mortgages and this may reflect either an over or under utilization of the balance sheet or their risk appetite.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preparation\n",
    "Before digging in, let's install our python requirements and follow the instructions for setting up our docker environment and tools in the [README.md](file:///../README.md)"

    "2. Our next and complementary set of information comes from the census bureau. We will use their county business patterns series which aggregate economic information at a county level. I hope that this information will provide some valueable economic insight into regional economics that may affect an mortgage approval decision.\n",

This data will come into use towards the end of the project as we begin to look across time periods as it should give us an indication of both the financial conditions and sentiment of the originating institutions.\n",
